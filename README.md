PaperChase
==========

PaperChase is an RSS reader aimed at people working in academia. 

One of the main tasks of an academic is to keep up with new pubblications and research. With an ever increasing number of journals and articles published every day filtering interesting work becomes difficult.

PaperChase uses RSS feeds published by pubblications to detect when new articles are published. It then connects to the journal website to extract information, e.g. abstracts, that wasn't available in the feed but that it is still available for free to unregistered users.

It aims at ranking every new article according to the user research interests making it easier to stay on top of new developments in your field.

It serves the articles it collects through vartious medium, web, mobile and desktop application in order to maximise its reach and usefulness to the community.
